            <h3>Know more about me</h3>

            <p>I grew up in the region of Bretagne in France together with my family surrounded by beaches and dramatic cliffs. When I turned
                 18, I decided to move to Canada to study civil engineering at “Polytechnique Montréal”. After my graduation I went on
                  a 3-month trip to South-East Asia, which made me want to keep living abroad while working. Since then, I have lived in
                   New Delhi for 1,5 years working for a multinational French railway company and in Jakarta for 2 years while employed by 
                   the French Development Agency. These abroad experiences have made me grow up personally and made me become very 
                   resourceful. Working and meeting people from around the world has developed my interpersonal skills and my ability to 
                   bring team spirit to the crew.  
            </p>
            <p>
                During the two years I spent in Indonesia, I became fascinated with the underwater world and the marine life that I could
                 explore while doing free diving and SCUBA diving. It became my main hobby and I spent most of my spare time discovering
                  hidden gems and natural wonders of the Indonesian archipelago.  
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing my contract in Jakarta, I traveled to Mexico to spend three months in the island of Cozumel and learn how 
                to dive on a professional level. This experience didn't only make me advance in SCUBA diving; it also allowed me to meet the
                 person that made me move to Sweden in May 2022. Since then, I have studied Swedish independently and through SFI since
                  September. I could recently advance from SFI level C to D which is equivalent to the CERF level B1. Beyond the language,
                   I am also learning about Swedish society and culture including “kallbad”, saunas and Midsummer. As mentioned in
                    <a href="skills-and-experiences.html">this section</a>, I more recently started learning coding following an
                     online module parallel to my Swedish studies. And now here I am writing those lines in what is actually my first website.
