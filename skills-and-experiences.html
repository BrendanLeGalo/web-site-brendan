            <P>
              My interest in programming begun during my civil engineering studies when I was introduced to MATLAB. I enjoyed the logic of it
               and found it challenging. Since then, I have been working with multiple design software using BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology. This experience 
               has made me want to learn more about programming so I recently decided to take a turn in my career and to dive into the
                web development world. The online development training I am currently following has reinforced my motivation to do so.
            </P>
            <p>
              Having a solid professional experience working in different engineering companies and with varied technologies, I am sure that
               my flexibility and ability to adapt will make me find my place in any company when working as a development consultant.
            </p>
            <h3>Studies</h3>
            <p>I started learning coding by myself in December 2022 using an online module called "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"
               available on Udemy. For now, I started to learn HTML and CSS and I have also recently started to use Bootstrap (not implemented
                yet into this website).
            </p>
            <p>The content of the program includes, among others:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>HTML,</li>
                <li>CSS,</li>
                <li>Javascript,</li>
                <li>Node,</li>
                <li>React,</li>
                <li>MongoDB,</li>
                <li>Web3 and DApps</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">More detail</a> about this program</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>My main goal is to get into the Full Stack Javascript Career Program at SALT to become a professional full-stack developer.
               Being aware of the intensiveness of the training program at SALT, I will dedicate the coming months to move forward on my learning,
                in order to start the training with a strong and relevant background that will allow me to increase my readiness criteria and to
                 take the most benefits of the program.

              <div class="text-content">
                
                <p>I graduated from Polytechnique Montr√©al as a civil engineer in 2016 and have since then gained professional experience as a BIM (Building Information Modeling) Coordinator 
                  at a multinational railway company called SYSTRA and as a Project Officer in the transportation field at the AFD (French Development Agency).
                </p>
                <p>I have worked on major overseas transportation projects such as on MyHSR (High Speed Railway between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore) and on HS2
                   (High Speed Railway between London and Birmingham) for the SYSTRA Group, initially in Paris and then in New Delhi. During my time in India,
                    I also gained experience managing the production of a 3D model video for the VIA HFR Project (High Frequency Rail linking Quebec City and
                     Toronto). Afterwards, I had the opportunity to work for the AFD where I was handling the operational management of the transport portfolio
                      in Indonesia. In addition to monitoring already existing projects, I was able to participate in the identification and implementation of
                       a new project that was aiming to develop a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for the metropolitan area of Medan.
                </p>
                <p>My studies and my interest in civil engineering have brought me a wide range of knowledge in the structural field, in soil mechanics, 
                  in hydraulics as well as in the field of transportation. As a coordinator I was privileged to work with people from around the world with
                   different specialties, collaborating with both the contracting authority and the consultancy firm. I have improved my knowledge in project
                    preparation and the bidding process. In addition, I developed competence in project coordination using BIM technology.
